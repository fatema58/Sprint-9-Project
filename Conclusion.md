Congratulations! You have completed the "Machine Learning in Business" course.

You have learned to: 

Distinguish between offline metrics and online metrics;
Use bootstrap to calculate confidence intervals and business metrics;
Perform cross-validation so that conclusions about the model evaluation are more reliable.
Up next is the integrated project where you can test the acquired knowledge. And then the holidays!
